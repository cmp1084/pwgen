 1. Introduction
 ---------------
 pwgen is a random string generator that output random strings to the
 screen or to a file. The strings are considered random and secure.


 2. Who?
 -------
 pwgen was written by Marcus Jansson <mjansson256@yahoo.se>


 3. How to install?
 ------------------
 Compilation of the source is done by typing:
 # make

 Installation is done by typing:
 # make install

 or to install into a specific directory:
 # make install INSTALLDIR=/path/to/installdir

 Possibly as superuser if you dont have write permission to the INSTALLDIR.


 4. How does it work?
 --------------------
 Usage: pwgen [options]
Options:
 -v         Verbose
 -l <len> 	Lenght of random strings to generate (default is random 8-16)
 -n <nr>    Nr of strings to generate
 -e 		Exclude strange letters
 -i			Include strange letters (default)
 -s			Secure
 -o <file>	Output random strings to file <file>
 -a <file>  Append random strings to file <file>

 Example:
 # pwgen -n12 -s
 y3C'qC828(rD

 Example:
 # pwgen -e -n2 -o pwfile
 # cat pwfile

 5. Why?
 -------
 pwgen was written because I needed to quickly generate a few random
 strings.


 6. Other options?
 -----------------
 Yes, there are other programs available that probably are much better
 and secure. However, this might be a base to make something as good for
 yourself.

Ok, have fun, take care.
