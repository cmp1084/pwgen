 4. Why?
 -------
 pwgen was written because I needed to quickly generate a few random 
 strings.
 
 5. Other options?
 -----------------
 No, there are other programs available that probably are much better 
 and secure. However, this might be a base to make something as good for 
 yourself.

Ok, have fun, take care.
